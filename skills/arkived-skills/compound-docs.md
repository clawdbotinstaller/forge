# compound-docs Skill

**Purpose:** Automatically document solved problems to build searchable institutional knowledge with category-based organization (enum-validated problem types).

## Overview

This skill captures problem solutions immediately after confirmation, creating structured documentation that serves as a searchable knowledge base for future sessions.

**Organization:** Single-file architecture - each problem documented as one markdown file in its symptom category directory (e.g., `docs/solutions/performance-issues/n-plus-one-briefs.md`). Files use YAML frontmatter for metadata and searchability.

---

## 7-Step Process

### Step 1: Detect Confirmation

**Auto-invoke after phrases:**

- "that worked"
- "it's fixed"
- "working now"
- "problem solved"
- "that did it"

**OR manual:** `/doc-fix` command

**Non-trivial problems only:**

- Multiple investigation attempts needed
- Tricky debugging that took time
- Non-obvious solution
- Future sessions would benefit

**Skip documentation for:**

- Simple typos
- Obvious syntax errors
- Trivial fixes immediately corrected

### Step 2: Gather Context

Extract from conversation history:

**Required information:**

- **Module name**: Which module or component had the problem
- **Symptom**: Observable error/behavior (exact error messages)
- **Investigation attempts**: What didn't work and why
- **Root cause**: Technical explanation of actual problem
- **Solution**: What fixed it (code/config changes)
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future

**Environment details:**

- Rails version
- Stage (0-6 or post-implementation)
- OS version
- File/line references

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:** If critical context is missing (module name, exact error, stage, or resolution steps), ask user and WAIT for response before proceeding to Step 3:

```
I need a few details to document this properly:

1. Which module had this issue? [ModuleName]
2. What was the exact error message or symptom?
3. What stage were you in? (0-6 or post-implementation)

[Continue after user provides details]
```

### Step 3: Check Existing Docs

Search docs/solutions/ for similar issues:

```bash
# Search by error message keywords
grep -r "exact error phrase" docs/solutions/

# Search by symptom category
ls docs/solutions/[category]/
```

**IF similar issue found:**

THEN present decision options:

```
Found similar issue: docs/solutions/[path]

What's next?
1. Create new doc with cross-reference (recommended)
2. Update existing doc (only if same root cause)
3. Other

Choose (1-3): _
```

WAIT for user response, then execute chosen action.

**ELSE** (no similar issue found):

Proceed directly to Step 4 (no user interaction needed).

### Step 4: Generate Filename

Format: `[sanitized-symptom]-[module]-[YYYYMMDD].md`

**Sanitization rules:**

- Lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Truncate to reasonable length (< 80 chars)

**Examples:**

- `missing-include-BriefSystem-20251110.md`
- `parameter-not-saving-state-EmailProcessing-20251110.md`
- `webview-crash-on-resize-Assistant-20251110.md`

### Step 5: Validate YAML Schema

**CRITICAL:** All docs require validated YAML frontmatter with enum validation.

**Validate against schema:**
Ensure all required fields are present and match allowed values exactly.

**BLOCK if validation fails:**

```
❌ YAML validation failed

Errors:
- problem_type: must be one of schema enums, got "compilation_error"
- severity: must be one of [critical, high, medium, low], got "invalid"
- symptoms: must be array with 1-5 items, got string

Please provide corrected values.
```

**GATE ENFORCEMENT:** Do NOT proceed to Step 6 (Create Documentation) until YAML frontmatter passes all validation rules.

### Step 6: Create Documentation

**Determine category from problem_type:**

**Create documentation file:**

```bash
PROBLEM_TYPE="[from validated YAML]"
CATEGORY="[mapped from problem_type]"
FILENAME="[generated-filename].md"
DOC_PATH="docs/solutions/${CATEGORY}/${FILENAME}"

# Create directory if needed
mkdir -p "docs/solutions/${CATEGORY}"

# Write documentation
```

**Result:**
- Single file in category directory
- Enum validation ensures consistent categorization

### Step 7: Cross-Reference & Critical Pattern Detection

If similar issues found in Step 3:

**Update existing doc:**

```bash
# Add Related Issues link to similar doc
echo "- See also: [$FILENAME]($REAL_FILE)" >> [similar-doc.md]
```

**Update new doc:**
Already includes cross-reference from Step 6.

**Update patterns if applicable:**

If this represents a common pattern (3+ similar issues):

```bash
# Add to docs/solutions/patterns/common-solutions.md
cat >> docs/solutions/patterns/common-solutions.md << 'EOF'

## [Pattern Name]

**Common symptom:** [Description]
**Root cause:** [Technical explanation]
**Solution pattern:** [General approach]

**Examples:**
- [Link to doc 1]
- [Link to doc 2]
- [Link to doc 3]
EOF
```

## Decision Menu After Capture

After successful documentation, present options and WAIT for user response:

```
✓ Solution documented

File created:
- docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md

What's next?
1. Continue workflow (recommended)
2. Add to Required Reading - Promote to critical patterns (critical-patterns.md)
3. Link related issues - Connect to similar problems
4. Add to existing skill - Add to a learning skill (e.g., hotwire-native)
5. Create new skill - Extract into new learning skill
6. View documentation - See what was captured
7. Other
```

---

## Success Criteria

Documentation is successful when ALL of the following are true:

- ✅ YAML frontmatter validated (all required fields, correct formats)
- ✅ File created in docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md
- ✅ Code examples included in solution section
- ✅ Cross-references added if related issues found
- ✅ User presented with decision menu and action confirmed

---

## Quality Guidelines

**Good documentation has:**

- ✅ Exact error messages (copy-paste from output)
- ✅ Specific file:line references
- ✅ Observable symptoms (what you saw, not interpretations)
- ✅ Failed attempts documented (helps avoid wrong paths)
- ✅ Technical explanation (not just "what" but "why")
- ✅ Code examples (before/after if applicable)
- ✅ Prevention guidance (how to catch early)
- ✅ Cross-references (related issues)

**Avoid:**

- ❌ Vague descriptions ("something was wrong")
- ❌ Missing technical details ("fixed the code")
- ❌ No context (which version? which file?)
- ❌ Just code dumps (explain why it works)
- ❌ No prevention guidance
- ❌ No cross-references
