# /forge:learn

Continuous learning with pattern extraction and CLAUDE.md updates.

## Process

1. **Extract patterns** - Reusable solutions
2. **Capture learnings** - Problems solved
3. **Record decisions** - Architecture choices
4. **Update metrics** - Workflow statistics
5. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Auto-update docs
6. **Cleanup** - Remove temp files

## Outputs

- Patterns in `.claude/memory/patterns/`
- Learnings in `.claude/memory/learnings/`
- Decisions in `.claude/memory/decisions/`
- Updated CLAUDE.md

## Compounding

Each workflow makes future work easier:
- First: 95 min (research + solve + document)
- Second: 10 min (search + apply)
- Third: 2 min (pattern known)

## Required Skill

**REQUIRED:** `@forge-learn`
